- Initialize a QuantumCircuit with four qubits
- Using the poly-logic gates, set the qubits into the basis state 1,1,0,1
- Reminder - the least significant qubit is at index zero, on the far right and the most significant bit, index 3, is on the left.
```
         qubit 0
           |
   | 1 1 0 1 >
     |
   qubit 3
